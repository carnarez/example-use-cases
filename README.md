**Small exercises used for training across the years.** Not everything is relevant
anymore, or even worth spending time on.

* [Async API](async-api) where one can explore a simple `Celery`/`Redis`-based
  construct to tackle long-lasting API requests. (_The folder already contains
  implementations of both synchronous and asynchronous versions._)
* [Database exploration](database-exploration) where one can play with containerized
  SQL and NoSQL services, and learn a few things regarding relational databases,
  hashing _vs._ encryption, pub/sub, and a few more details.
* [Incoming traffic](incoming-traffic) where one can explore a small pub/sub use case
  involving license plate being streamed in for OCR and checks. :construction:
* [Kubernetes exploration](kubernetes-exploration) where one can play with `microk8s`
  (or any other local distribution of `Kubernetes`) to deploy a few containers. Will be
  extended with extras whenever time allows. (_The folder contains the answers to the
  exercises in the_ `kubernetes.yaml` _files._)
* [NoSQL datawarehouse](nosql-datawarehouse) where one can explore an attempt at
  tackling the eternal issue of datawarehousing and historization in an integrated,
  centric way using a NoSQL database. And some more little things around. :construction:
* [Scraping meridians](scraping-meridians) where one is offered to scrape some content
  off _Wikipedia_ to generate a 3D representation of our planet. Let's go wild on the
  visualizations, shall we?
